### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the HR Policy Feature

**1\. Feature Overview**

The HR Policy module serves as the central knowledge base for all company policies and procedures. It digitizes and organizes policy documents, making them easily accessible and searchable for both HR professionals and employees. A key component is the integration with the WhatsApp chatbot, which allows employees to ask natural language questions about policies and receive instant, accurate answers. This feature aims to eliminate ambiguity and ensure every employee has a clear understanding of company rules.

**2\. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Primary Goal:** Create a single, accessible source of truth for all HR-related policies.
    
*   **Objective 1:** \[Inference\]: Reduce the number of repetitive policy-related questions HR receives by enabling employee self-service via a chatbot.
    
*   **Objective 2:** Ensure policy information is consistent, up-to-date, and easily searchable.
    
*   **Objective 3:** Provide HR with a tool to effectively manage and communicate policy updates.
    

**3\. User Stories**

*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to upload and categorize new policy documents so they are easily found by employees.
    
*   **As an Employee,** I want to ask the WhatsApp chatbot a question like, "What is the policy for sick leave?" and get a direct answer.
    
*   **As an Employee,** I want to find the official company policy document for working from home so I can read the full details.
    
*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to publish a new policy and have the system automatically notify all employees about the update.
    

**4\. Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1. Policy Management & Content Repository:**
    
    *   HR users must be able to **upload, edit, and organize policy documents** (e.g., in PDF, DOCX format).
        
    *   The system should include a **version control system** to track changes and revisions to each policy.
        
    *   Policies must be categorizable by topic (e.g., Leave, Code of Conduct, IT Policy) for easy navigation.
        
*   **4.2. Search and Retrieval:**
    
    *   The platform must have a robust **search function** that allows HR users to quickly find policies by keyword.
        
    *   For the WhatsApp chatbot, the AI must be able to **process natural language queries** and identify the most relevant policy information to provide a concise answer.
        
    *   The chatbot should also provide a link to the full policy document when a detailed answer is needed.
        
*   **4.3. Employee Access & Communication:**
    
    *   All employees should be able to access the policy information via the **WhatsApp chatbot**, without needing to log in to the main HR platform.
        
    *   The system must allow HR to **publish new policies or updates** and send push notifications to all employees.
        
    *   The platform should track employee acknowledgment of important policy changes.
        
*   **4.4. AI-Powered Summarization:**
    
    *   \[Inference\]: The AI component should be able to **read a policy document and generate a concise summary** that can be delivered as a short answer via the chatbot. For example, for a "Paid Time Off Policy," it could pull key information like accrual rates and maximum days.
        
    *   \[Inference\]: It should also be able to **answer follow-up questions** related to the policy.
        

**5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Accuracy:** The chatbot's responses must be highly accurate and directly tied to the approved policy documents.
    
*   **Security:** Access to sensitive policies should be restricted to the relevant groups of employees. The chatbot communication must be secure and encrypted.
    
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of policy documents and simultaneous queries from employees without performance issues.
    
*   **Compliance:** The feature must support an audit trail to prove when policies were published and when employees acknowledged them.
    

**6\. Assumptions**

*   HR will be responsible for keeping all policy documents up-to-date within the platform.
    
*   The AI engine can be trained effectively to understand policy language and provide accurate summaries and answers.
    
*   The WhatsApp Business API integration is stable and reliable for real-time communication.
    

**7\. Success Criteria**

*   The number of policy-related questions received by the HR team decreases by at least 40%.
    
*   Employees report a high level of satisfaction with the ease of finding policy information through the chatbot.
    
*   The systemâ€™s policy search function returns a relevant result in under 3 seconds.
