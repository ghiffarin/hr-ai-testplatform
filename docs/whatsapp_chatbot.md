### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the WhatsApp Chatbot Feature

**1\. Feature Overview**

The WhatsApp Chatbot is the primary interface for all employees to interact with the HR platform. It provides an intuitive, conversational way for employees to ask questions and submit requests without needing to log into a separate web application. This chatbot acts as the bridge between the employee and the HR team, using AI to automate responses to common queries and routing more complex tasks to the appropriate HR professional on the main dashboard.

**2\. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Primary Goal:** Provide employees with a quick, easy, and familiar way to access HR information and services.
    
*   **Objective 1:** \[Inference\]: Reduce the number of direct inquiries to the HR department by automating answers to frequently asked questions.
    
*   **Objective 2:** Enable a seamless two-way request process where employees can initiate a task and HR can manage it through a unified system.
    
*   **Objective 3:** Enhance employee satisfaction by offering instant access to information.
    

**3\. User Stories**

*   **As an Employee,** I want to ask about my paid time off balance through the WhatsApp chatbot so I can quickly check it without contacting HR.
    
*   **As an Employee,** I want to request a letter of employment by typing a simple message so I don't have to fill out a form.
    
*   **As an Employee,** I want to ask a question about the company's dress code policy and get a clear, concise answer instantly.
    
*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to receive a notification and a link to a new request submitted via the chatbot so I can approve or deny it on the dashboard.
    

**4\. Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1. Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
    
    *   The chatbot must be able to **understand natural language queries** from employees. It should not rely on a rigid menu-based system.
        
    *   \[Inference\]: It must accurately **identify the user's intent**, whether it's a question about a policy, a request for a document, or an inquiry about personal data.
        
*   **4.2. Knowledge Base Integration (with HR Policy Module):**
    
    *   The chatbot must be able to **access the central HR Policy knowledge base**.
        
    *   It will provide a **direct, conversational answer** to policy questions and include a link to the full document.
        
    *   \[Inference\]: The AI will summarize complex policies into simple, easy-to-understand responses.
        
*   **4.3. Request Submission & Tracking:**
    
    *   Employees can **initiate administrative requests** (e.g., leave requests, document requests) by simply stating their need in the chat.
        
    *   The chatbot will guide the employee to provide necessary details and will then **create a corresponding task on the HR dashboard.**
        
    *   It must provide **real-time status updates** to the employee on their request (e.g., "Your leave request is pending approval").
        
*   **4.4. Employee Information Retrieval:**
    
    *   The chatbot should be able to **retrieve and display personal information** for the authenticated user, such as remaining leave days, or their job title.
        
    *   Access to this information must be highly secure and authenticated.
        
*   **4.5. Escalation & Human Handoff:**
    
    *   When the chatbot cannot answer a query or a request is complex, it must be able to **notify an HR professional** and provide the chat transcript to them on the dashboard for a seamless handoff.
        
*   **4.6. Multi-language Support:** \[Unverified\]: The chatbot should support the primary language of the organization and can be expanded to other languages if needed.
    

**5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Authentication & Security:** The chatbot must securely authenticate the employee to ensure they can only access their own data. All communication must be encrypted end-to-end.
    
*   **Accuracy:** The chatbot's responses must be highly accurate, especially for policy and personal data inquiries.
    
*   **Response Time:** The chatbot should provide responses within a few seconds to maintain a smooth user experience.
    
*   **Privacy:** All employee interactions with the chatbot must be treated as confidential and handled in compliance with privacy regulations.
    
*   **Reliability:** The integration with the WhatsApp Business API must be stable and have minimal downtime.
    

**6\. Assumptions**

*   The platform has a secure method to verify the employee's identity via their phone number.
    
*   The NLP model can be trained with sufficient data to understand a wide range of HR-related questions.
    
*   The WhatsApp Business API is stable and reliable for real-time, two-way communication.
    

**7\. Success Criteria**

*   The number of calls and emails to the HR department for routine inquiries decreases by 30%.
    
*   Employee satisfaction with HR services, measured via surveys, increases by 15%.
    
*   The chatbot successfully handles over 80% of all incoming queries without human intervention.
