### Visual Style Guide PRD

This document outlines the visual style guide for the HR-AI platform, based on the provided mockups. It defines the core design principles, color palette, typography, and component styling to ensure a consistent and professional user experience across all modules.

### Core Design Principles

The design is **clean and professional**, prioritizing a modern and uncluttered feel. We use an **intuitive navigation** system with a left-hand sidebar and a top-level breadcrumb to help users orient themselves. The interface is **action-oriented**, using prominent buttons and interactive elements to guide the user towards key tasks. A **subtle and soft** aesthetic is achieved through rounded corners, soft shadows, and a light color palette.

### Color Palette

The color palette is minimalist, primarily using shades of blue, gray, and white with accent colors for status indicators.

*   **Primary Blue (#4367C9):** A deep, professional blue used for main buttons, active states, and key navigation elements.
    
*   **Light Blue (#DEE5F6):** A subtle shade of blue for backgrounds of active list items and other soft accents.
    
*   **Text & Icons (#3C3C3C):** A dark gray, almost black, for all primary text and icons to ensure high readability.
    
*   **UI Gray (#E6E6E6):** A light gray for borders, inactive buttons, and separators.
    
*   **Success Green (#65B173):** Used to indicate positive statuses, like an 'Active' employee.
    
*   **Warning/Error Red (#EE7A7A):** Used for negative statuses, such as a 'Terminated' employee.
    

### Typography

The typography uses a clean, modern, and highly legible sans-serif font family.

*   **Font Family:** \[Inference\]: A generic sans-serif font like **Inter** or **Roboto** is likely used.
    
*   **Headings:** Headings are in a bold or semi-bold weight with the dark gray color (#3C3C3C) to stand out.
    
*   **Body Text:** Standard text uses a regular weight and the same dark gray color for high readability.
    
*   **Labels:** Labels and secondary information use a smaller font size and a lighter gray to differentiate them from core text.
    

### Component Styling

*   **Buttons:**
    
    *   **Primary:** Features a solid **blue background (#4367C9)**, white text, and rounded corners.
        
    *   **Secondary:** Has a white background, a blue border, blue text, and rounded corners.
        
*   **Cards & Containers:**
    
    *   Content is placed within **white cards** with a subtle gray border or a soft shadow.
        
    *   All cards, buttons, and input fields consistently use **rounded corners**.
        
*   **Navigation:**
    
    *   The **left-hand sidebar** uses icons and text labels.
        
    *   The **active state** of a navigation item is highlighted with a light blue background (#DEE5F6) and solid blue icon/text.
        
*   **Status Tags:**
    
    *   Small, **pill-shaped tags** indicate status (e.g., 'Active', 'Terminated').
        
    *   Their background color corresponds to the status (e.g., Green for 'Active').
        
*   **Form Inputs:**
    
    *   All input fields have a **light gray border** and rounded corners for a consistent look.
