### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the HR Insights Feature

**1\. Feature Overview**

The HR Insights feature is an AI-powered module designed to analyze HR data and provide actionable intelligence to HR professionals. It moves beyond simple reporting by identifying trends, predicting potential issues, and offering data-driven recommendations. The goal is to help HR teams shift from reactive to proactive strategies, addressing challenges like high turnover or skill gaps before they become critical.

**2\. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Primary Goal:** Transform raw HR data into valuable, actionable insights.
    
*   **Objective 1:** \[Inference\]: Predict employee turnover and identify at-risk individuals or departments.
    
*   **Objective 2:** Provide a deeper understanding of employee sentiment and engagement.
    
*   **Objective 3:** Offer data-backed recommendations to improve HR policies and workforce planning.
    

**3\. User Stories**

*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to see which departments have the highest turnover risk so I can proactively address underlying issues.
    
*   **As an HR Manager,** I want to analyze trends in employee questions and feedback from the chatbot so I can identify common pain points.
    
*   **As a Recruiter,** I want to see a projection of hiring needs for the next quarter based on turnover predictions so I can plan my recruitment efforts.
    
*   **As an HR Director,** I want to see a visualization of employee engagement across different teams so I can focus on areas that need improvement.
    

**4\. Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1. Turnover Prediction & Analysis:**
    
    *   The system must use historical data to **predict which employees are at a high risk of leaving.** This should be presented with a confidence score.
        
    *   It must provide a **breakdown of turnover by department, role, and tenure,** highlighting key trends.
        
    *   \[Inference\]: The system should identify **potential reasons for turnover** (e.g., compensation, lack of career growth) based on aggregated, anonymized data.
        
*   **4.2. Sentiment Analysis (from Chatbot Data):**
    
    *   The system must process anonymized employee interactions from the WhatsApp chatbot.
        
    *   It will **classify the sentiment of conversations** as positive, neutral, or negative.
        
    *   A dashboard view must show the **overall sentiment trend over time** and highlight specific topics associated with negative sentiment (e.g., "policy XYZ queries have a high negative sentiment").
        
*   **4.3. Workforce Planning Projections:**
    
    *   \[Inference\]: Based on turnover predictions and business growth targets (if provided), the system must **project future hiring needs.**
        
    *   It should show a forecast of necessary new hires by department and role for the next 3, 6, and 12 months.
        
*   **4.4. Policy & Training Recommendations:**
    
    *   \[Inference\]: The system should **analyze employee feedback and common queries** to suggest improvements to existing policies. For example, if many employees ask about flexible work, it may recommend updating the WFH policy.
        
    *   \[Inference\]: It should also **identify skill gaps** by analyzing job roles and performance data to recommend relevant training programs.
        

**5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Data Privacy:** All data used for analysis, especially from chatbot interactions, must be fully anonymized to protect individual employee privacy. The system must not display sensitive, personally identifiable information in its insights.
    
*   **Accuracy:** The AI models for prediction and sentiment analysis should have a high level of accuracy. \[Unverified\] The target accuracy for turnover prediction is 80%.
    
*   **Performance:** The insights dashboard must load quickly, and AI model calculations should not cause significant system lag.
    
*   **Explainability:** The system should provide a simple explanation for its predictions and recommendations (e.g., "Employee X is at risk of leaving due to their low engagement score and recent low performance review.").
    

**6\. Assumptions**

*   The platform has access to historical and real-time employee data, including demographic information, performance reviews, and chatbot interaction logs.
    
*   Data is clean, structured, and available in a format that AI models can process.
    
*   The system is capable of integrating and processing large volumes of data securely.
    

**7\. Success Criteria**

*   HR professionals use the insights to inform at least 50% of their strategic workforce planning decisions.
    
*   The HR team proactively addresses at least 3 high-risk turnover cases identified by the system per quarter.
    
*   The systemâ€™s sentiment analysis accurately reflects employee feedback, leading to at least one policy update per year based on its recommendations.
    

### \[Speculation\] High-Level ERD for HR Insights

This conceptual ERD shows the core entities that would feed data into the HR Insights module. This module itself is a process or an "analytics layer," not a new core entity, so the ERD illustrates its data sources.

*   **Employee Entity:**
    
    *   employee\_id (Primary Key)
        
    *   hire\_date
        
    *   job\_title
        
    *   department\_id (Foreign Key)
        
    *   salary
        
*   **Performance\_Review Entity:**
    
    *   review\_id (Primary Key)
        
    *   employee\_id (Foreign Key)
        
    *   rating
        
    *   review\_date
        
*   **Chatbot\_Interaction Entity:**
    
    *   interaction\_id (Primary Key)
        
    *   employee\_id (Foreign Key)
        
    *   query\_text
        
    *   timestamp
        
    *   sentiment\_score (This would be calculated and stored by the AI layer)
        
*   **Turnover\_History Entity:**
    
    *   record\_id (Primary Key)
        
    *   employee\_id (Foreign Key)
        
    *   exit\_date
        
    *   reason\_for\_leaving (if available)
        

**Relationships:**

*   The HR Insights process **pulls data** from the Employee, Performance\_Review, Chatbot\_Interaction, and Turnover\_History entities.
    
*   The **output of the analysis** is then presented on the Main Dashboard and within the HR Insights UI.
