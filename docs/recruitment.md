### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Recruitment Feature

**1\. Feature Overview**

The Recruitment module is designed to streamline the entire hiring process for HR professionals and recruiters. It serves as a centralized Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that integrates with AI to automate key tasks, such as candidate sourcing and resume screening. The module's primary goal is to make the recruitment workflow more efficient, reduce time-to-hire, and help identify the best-fit candidates for open positions.

**2\. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Primary Goal:** Automate and optimize the recruitment lifecycle from job posting to candidate management.
    
*   **Objective 1:** Reduce the manual effort required for screening and shortlisting candidates.
    
*   **Objective 2:** Improve the quality of hires by using AI to match candidates to job requirements.
    
*   **Objective 3:** Provide a transparent and organized view of the entire recruitment pipeline.
    

**3\. User Stories**

*   **As a Recruiter,** I want to post a new job opening and have it automatically published to multiple job boards so I can save time on manual entry.
    
*   **As a Recruiter,** I want the AI to automatically screen incoming resumes and rank them based on how well they match the job description so I can focus on the best candidates.
    
*   **As a Hiring Manager,** I want to see a candidate's full interview history and feedback from all interviewers in one place so I can make an informed decision.
    
*   **As a Recruiter,** I want to be able to send automated, personalized email updates to candidates so they stay informed about their application status.
    

**4\. Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1. Job Requisition & Posting:**
    
    *   HR users must be able to create a new job requisition with details such as title, description, department, salary range, and required skills.
        
    *   The system should be able to **publish job postings to a company career page** and potentially integrate with popular job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed) through APIs.
        
*   **4.2. Candidate Sourcing & Tracking:**
    
    *   Candidates should be able to apply directly through the platform or be added by a recruiter.
        
    *   The system must act as an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)**, allowing recruiters to move candidates through a customizable pipeline (e.g., Applied, Screening, Interview, Offer, Hired).
        
    *   It must provide a centralized profile for each candidate, storing their resume, contact information, interview notes, and communication history.
        
*   **4.3. AI-Powered Resume Screening & Matching:**
    
    *   \[Inference\]: When a new resume is submitted, the AI engine will **parse the document and extract key information** (e.g., skills, experience, education).
        
    *   \[Inference\]: The system will **score each candidate based on their match percentage** against the job description and required skills. This score will be displayed prominently on the candidate's profile.
        
    *   Recruiters should be able to filter and sort candidates by their match score to quickly identify top applicants.
        
*   **4.4. Interview Scheduling & Feedback:**
    
    *   Recruiters should be able to send interview invitations to candidates and interviewers directly from the platform.
        
    *   Interviewers must have a dedicated space to **submit feedback and ratings** on a candidate.
        
    *   All feedback should be consolidated and visible to all approved stakeholders.
        
*   **4.5. Offer Management:**
    
    *   The system must allow HR users to **generate and send offer letters** with predefined templates.
        
    *   It should track the status of offers (e.g., Sent, Accepted, Declined).
        

**5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Security:** Candidate data must be stored securely, and access should be restricted to authorized users. The system must comply with data privacy regulations.
    
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a high volume of job postings and thousands of candidate applications without performance degradation.
    
*   **Integration:** The platform needs to support integration with third-party services like job boards, email clients, and calendaring systems.
    
*   **Usability:** The interface for managing candidates and jobs should be intuitive, with a clear drag-and-drop or status-based workflow.
    

**6\. Assumptions**

*   The AI model for resume screening and matching is already developed or can be acquired.
    
*   Integration APIs for job boards are available and can be used without significant development effort.
    
*   Recruiters are willing to trust and use the AI-generated matching scores to guide their decisions.
    

**7\. Success Criteria**

*   The average time-to-hire is reduced by at least 20%.
    
*   Recruiters report a 30% reduction in time spent on manual resume screening.
    
*   The system accurately matches at least 80% of top candidates to job descriptions based on a manual review by a recruiter.
